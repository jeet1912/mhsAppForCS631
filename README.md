<!--KEY POINTS:
MHS is interested in three applications: Employee and Facility Management, Patient Management (appointments, procedures and billing), and Management Reporting.
The last application is crucial in decision making by management and the Accounting Department.

FEATURES:
1.	Employee and Facility Management :
insert / update / view utilities for: 
•	Employees 
•	Medical offices 
•	Out-patient surgery facilities 
•	Employee assignments 
•	Insurance companies 
•	Any additional necessary entities

2.	Patient Management
The Patient Management application provides functions to allow for insert/entry/view of activities and revenue such as: 
•	Create new patient records. 
•	Create appointments and update with charges when complete. 
•	Generate daily insurance company invoices with patient subtotals.

3.	Management and Reporting 
Management uses this application to review and/or change operations, manage its workforce and measure the business’s financial performance. 
This program provides statistics used by management to analyze its income, facilities, employees and patients. 

In particular, the program should be able to make the following computations: 

•	For a given day, a report of the revenue (patient charges recorded) by facility, with subtotals and a total. 
•	For a user-selected date and a user-selected physician, a list of appointments. 
•	For a user-selected time period (begin date and end date) and a user-selected facility, a list of appointments with detail for date-time, physician, patient, and description. 
•	For a user-selected month compute the 5 best days (in terms of total revenue) for MHS. 
•	For a user-selected time period (begin date and end date) compute the average daily revenue for each insurance company
